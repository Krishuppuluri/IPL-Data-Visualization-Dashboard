## Project Overview

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a globally popular cricket tournament. This project leverages data analytics and visualization to assist team management in making informed decisions regarding team selection, player acquisition, and game strategies. By analyzing historical match data, the project provides insights into player performance, team trends, and key metrics.

The solution includes:
- Data preprocessing and integration.
- Feature extraction from match and ball-by-ball data.
- Interactive dashboards for team and player analysis.

## Features

- **Player Performance Analysis**: Evaluate individual player statistics, including runs scored, wickets taken, and dismissal types.
- **Team Performance Trends**: Analyze team trends over multiple seasons.
- **Management View**: Compare teams' strengths and weaknesses for auctions and game strategies.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize performance metrics with Tableau.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: Primary tool for data visualization.
- **Excel**: Data preprocessing and feature extraction.
- **Kaggle Datasets**: Source of IPL data.
- **Python**: Optional use for advanced data manipulation.

## Data Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Match data (`matches.csv`): Contains match details such as match IDs, teams, dates, and results.
   - Ball-by-ball data (`deliveries.csv`): Provides granular details about every ball bowled in IPL matches.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned data to remove duplicates and inconsistencies.
   - Combined datasets into interconnected data tables for ease of visualization.
   - Extracted relevant features such as powerplay runs, death over runs, and team extras.

3. **Visualization Setup**:
   - Connected processed datasets to Tableau.
   - Created relationships between datasets for seamless dashboard integration.

## Visualizations and Dashboards

### Dashboard I: Management Perspective
- **Scores Comparison by Team**: Analyze run contributions across teams.
- **Extras Analysis**: Examine runs given as extras by each team.
- **Yearly Performance Trends**: Visualize team performance trends over multiple seasons.
- **Top and Bottom Teams**: Identify best and underperforming teams.

### Dashboard II: Player Performance Perspective
- **Player Statistics**: Analyze individual player contributions in terms of runs, wickets, and bowling performance.
- **Dismissal Analysis**: Evaluate the types of dismissals players contribute to or are subject to.

### Dashboard III: Team Improvement Areas
- **Extras Analysis by Category**: Visualize extra runs conceded by teams, categorized into wides, no-balls, etc.
- **Loss Factors**: Highlight areas where teams lose matches despite good batting or bowling performances.

## Future Work

1. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Predictive modeling for player and team performance using machine learning.
   - Inclusion of batsman posture and bowler performance areas for enhanced analysis.

2. **Expanded Dataset**:
   - Incorporate international and other domestic cricket leagues.

3. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Build more advanced dashboards using Tableau or similar tools.

4. **Enhanced Team Metrics**:
   - Analyze team dynamics, such as partnerships and fielding contributions.
